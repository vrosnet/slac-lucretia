Lucretia is a physics toolbox for the simulation of  high-performance single-pass electron beam transport systems.  It is designed to support studies of linear collider Low Emittance Transport (bunch compressor, linear accelerator, final focus), and also the transport and acceleration system of linac-driven free electron lasers.

The latest version of the code exists in a googlecode subversion repository and is the recommended source. Snapshots are available to download for specific architectures from the download links on the left toolbar. Also see here for the link to the online documentation web pages.
