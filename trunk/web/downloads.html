The Lucretia code is open-source:&nbsp; anyone can freely download any
or all of the source, examples, binaries, etc.&nbsp; Links to
facilitate downloading are below.&nbsp; The philosophy of the Lucretia
maintainers is to keep binaries (mex files) for the CURRENT version of
Matlab only in the download package and file repository. All
development and bugfixes/maintainance etc are done using the current
Matlab release. Although most m-files, and to a lesser extent the
mexfiles, will probably work for several versions back from the current one,
we cannot guarantee this as supported functions and the Matlab build
environment change over time.<br>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span class="auto-style1">Supported
Environments</span><br>
</div>

<br>
In theory, any environment supported by Matlab should be OK for running
Lucretia: Mathworks product support information for all Matlab versions
can be found
<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/support/product/sys_requirements.html?product=ML">here</a>.
We supply build files and the source code for compiling all included
mexfiles, if the supplied mexfiles do not work for you in your
environment, see the section below and try building your own versions.<br>

Lucretia is currentluy developed, and mexfiles built, under the
following list of environments:
<blockquote> Red Hat Linux (Enterprise Linux 6 64-bit)<em><strong><br>
</strong></em></blockquote>

<blockquote> Mac OSX (10.7, 64-bit only)<br>
</blockquote>

</div>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: left;">The complete source code and all mexfile
binaries can be downloaded from googlecode which performs code hosting
for the Lucretia project. The project home page is:<a href="http://code.google.com/p/slac-lucretia/"> </a><br>
<blockquote> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/slac-lucretia/">http://code.google.com/p/slac-lucretia/</a>
</blockquote>
<br>
Here you can download compressed packages of Lucretia snapshots (bzip2
tar format: extract with "tar --bzip2 -xf Lucretia.tar-bz2") and browse
the source code. The source code and compiled binaries for all
supported architectures are under subversion control. You can directly
download the most recent version of Lucretia using subversion:
<blockquote>
<pre>svn co https://slac-lucretia.googlecode.com/svn/trunk Lucretia</pre>
</blockquote>
<br>
will download all to a directory "Lucretia" for example (linux
command-line example), other subversion client programs for all major
operating systems are available.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note on use with GEANT4 subroutines:<br>
</span>If you wish to make use of the GEANT4 calling subroutines, you
must also have the required GEANT4 data files. For the tar
distributions, these are packaged along with the Lucretia distrubution
and you will get these automatically when you extract the everything
else. If you are using code checked out from the subversion repository,
you need to separately download and unpack the G4Data files into the
ExtProcess directory:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Download G4Data tarball from <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/accel/ilc/codes/Lucretia/package/G4Data.tar-bz2">here</a> into Lucretia/src/ExtProcess directory</li>
  <li>$ cd Lucretia/src/ExtProcess</li>
  <li>$ tar --bzip2 -xf G4Data.tar-bz2<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
</div>

<div class="auto-style2"> <strong>mexfile Source</strong></div>

<br>

The source code for Lucretia binary mex files exists as several c, c++,
and fortran files all contained in the Lucretia/src/mexsrc directory
and subdirectories therein. The "core" Lucretia binaries are built in
the mexsrc directory itself from c source files. See <a href="mexfiles.html">here</a> for a description of these mexfiles.
There is a Makefile included in the mexsrc directory for building. The
Makefile has some built-in documentation with descriptions of which
environment variables to alter to build the mexfiles for your
environment.<br>

There
are also separate directories containing the source code for the XSIF
parser (mexsrc/xsif) and for the Ground Motion code (mexsrc/matgm).
These source files are fortran77 and fortran90 based. Once again there
are self-describing Makefiles in each of these build directories. There
is also a seperate directory for the source for the GEANT4 interface
module, contained in the src/mexsrc/g4track directory. To build against
this to enable the GEANT4 process function to work from within
Lucretia: first build the g4track library object using the Makefile in
that directory (assumes GEANT4 v.10+ is installed on your system). Then
build Lucretia using the "make g4track" command. The distributed
TrackThru mex files (for linux 64-bit) are built including the GEANT4
libraries.<br>

The only known fortran compiler which works with current versions of
Matlab and these source files is the Intel fortran compiler.<br>

Run-time libraries for the Intel compiler and other required shared
object libraries are kept in the Lucretia/src/Libs directory (each
environment has a sub-directory). You should add the relevant Libs
directory to your shared object search path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable for Linux-based operating systems, PATH for
windows or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for Mac) before starting Matlab to
successfully run all mexfiles.<br>
