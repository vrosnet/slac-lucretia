<h2><strong>ISR</strong></h2>
<br>Lucretia allows the user to simulate incoherent synchrotron radiation losses in
dipole correctors, sector bends, quads, sextupoles, octupoles,
multipoles, and transverse-mode cavities.&nbsp; During tracking, there
are four possible methods of synchrotron radiation simulation, which
are determined by the SynRad tracking flag of each element:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlag.SynRad == 0:</span>&nbsp;
Synchrotron radiation is completely ignored.&nbsp; This is the default
settting of the SynRad tracking flag for all elements at instantiation
time.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlag.SynRad == 1:</span>&nbsp;
For each particle, the mean energy loss from synchrotron radiation is
calculated, taking into account the particle's momentum and the actual
field that it encounters (ie, particles which are far from the center
of a quad or other multipole magnet will have larger losses than
particles which are near the center of the magnet).&nbsp; Half of the
loss is applied at the upstream face of the element (ie, before
tracking), and half at the downstream face of the element (ie, after
tracking).&nbsp; In this way, the effect of the energy variation on the
particle's trajectory is approximately taken into account.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlag.SynRad == 2:</span>&nbsp;
For each particle, both the mean and the quantum-fluctuation components
of the synchrotron radiation are calculated.&nbsp; This is accomplished
by computing the photon critical energy (u_c) and mean number of
photons emitted (nphot) for each particle; for each particle generating
a Poisson-distribued random number with mean nphot to indicate the
actual number of photons emitted; and finally generating the actual
energy of each photon emitted by each particle according to the
incoherent synchrotron radiation spectrum.&nbsp; As with the previous
option, half the energy loss is applied pre-tracking and half is
applied post-tracking; the opening angle of the photon is
ignored.&nbsp; The spectrum generation uses a fast method developed by
A. Wolski; this method agrees very well with the analytically-expected
mean particle energy loss, and produces a spectrum of particle energy
losses which is a few percent wider than the analytically-expected one.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlag.SynRad == 3:</span>&nbsp;
Both the mean and quantum-fluctuation components of the synchrotron
radiation are calculated in exactly the method described above, except
that the generation of the photons uses H. Burkhardt's method.&nbsp; In
this case both the mean and the standard deviation of the particle
energy loss agree with the analytically-expected values to within
statistical errors, but the method is much slower than Wolski's.<br>
<br>
Methods 2 and 3 make use of Matlab's flat-distributed random number
generator, rand, in the generation of the Poisson-distributed random
numbers and also in the generation of the photon energies.&nbsp; All of
the methods make the thin-lens approximation:&nbsp; the magnetic field
experienced by a particle at the upstream face of an element, along
with its effective length, are assumed to be all that is needed to
compute the emitted radiation.&nbsp; Put another way, the fact that the
particle changes its transverse offset in a quad or other multipole
magnet, and thus changes the magnetic field that it samples as it
passes through the element, is ignored.&nbsp; If this is deemed to be
critical to correctly computing the synchrotron radiation, and its
effects on the beam dynamics, one can divide the magnets into
longitudinal slices which will more accurately emulate thin lens
elements for this purpose.<br>
<br>
The <a href="momentum_profile.html">momentum profile</a> tools will
also change their behavior based on the SynRad track flag:&nbsp; if
SynRad != 0, the
mean SR loss will be included in the momentum profile for bends,
correctors, TCAVs, and multipoles with a nonzero dipole field.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<h2><strong>CSR</strong></h2>
The implementation of Coherent Synchrotron Radiation in Lucretia uses the 
formulism developed in the paper by G. Stupakov and P. Emma in the EPAC2002 
paper "<a href="http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/e02/PAPERS/WEPRI029.pdf">CSR 
Wake for a Short Magnet in Ultrarelativistic Limit</a>". The implementation in 
Lucretia closely follows the method by which CSR was implemented in<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/Accelerator_Systems_Division/Accelerator_Operations_Physics/manuals/elegant_latest/elegant.pdf"> Elegant</a>. The Elegant implementation very well described measurement data 
taken during the commissioning of LCLS. The implementation here has been 
cross-checked against the example case in the Stupakov/Emma paper. It has also 
been cross-checked against Elegant for the specific case of FACET at SLAC.<br>
<br>CSR can be turned on through the use of the BEAMLINE <strong>TrackFlags.CSR
</strong>field (see below) on an SBEN element. When the tracking engine reaches 
an SBEN element with CSR track flag set, it slices up the element (according to 
defaults specified below), tracks through each slice and calculates an energy 
loss per beam slice (beam longitudinal slices also setable by user), applies the 
energy loss and continues. Upon exiting from the bend, further elements are also 
optionally split with the CSR field applied as calculated from the preceding 
bend. The cutoff distance from the bend for application of CSR effects is 
determined as per the description in the Stupakov/Emma paper. CSR effects are 
considered in all elements downstream from the bend up to the cutoff with the 
exception of RF and other bend elements. The CSR calculation relies upon a 
Matlab function which resides inside the src/Tracking directory (applyCSR.m) 
which should exist on your Matlab search path.<br><br>CSR tracking options (set 
through TrackFlag field on SBEN elements in BEAMLINE array, default values shown):<br>
<strong><br>TrackFlag.CSR = 0</strong><br>A setting of 0 means no CSR tracking 
to take place. An integer value &gt;0 switches on CSR effects in the corresponding 
SBEN element. The integer value set indicates the number of longitudinal slices 
(histogram bins) to use for the beam description in the CSR calculation. The 
optimal number depends upon the topology and number of macro particles within 
the tracked bunch. A minimum recommended number is 300. It is always advised to 
experiment with this setting to find a value which produces stable results 
without too much of a time overhead.<br><br><strong>TrackFlag.CSR_SmoothFactor 
= 5<br></strong>The longitudinal charge profile is smoothed after binning. This 
parameter (integer &gt;= 0) controls the degree of smoothing. The optimal value 
depends upon the number of bins used (.CSR field above) and the 'spikiness' of 
the longitudinal beam profile. If set =0 then no smoothing is performed. The larger the value, the more smoothing 
(approximately this is the width in bins of the smoothing filter). 
Experimentation is recommended.<br><br><strong>TrackFlag.Split</strong> =
<strong>10<br></strong>The number of slices to split the SBEN element into. This tracking flag is also independent of the 
CSR fields, it can be set independently- in which case the tracking engine 
treats the element as N sequential identical elements with lengths and strengths 
scaled appropriately. More splitting more closely represents reality but will 
slow down the tracking. Again, experimentation is recommended.<br><br><strong>
TrackFlag.CSR_DriftSplit = 10<br></strong>If set to 0, then no CSR treatment is 
applied beyond the downstream face of the SBEN. If integer &gt;0, then CSR is 
applied to the tracked beam downstream of the bend to a point downstream 
determined internally where the CSR field ceases to have a significant effect. 
The following elements are usually drifts (hence the flag name, but can include 
any element class other than LCAV or TCAV). The value of the CSR_DriftSplit flag 
determines the number of slices between the downstream SBEN face and the cutoff 
point to use. Depending on the number of downstream elements between bend and 
cutoff point, the elements are split so that the total number of tracking slices 
is at least this value. Note if the tracking engine encounters another SBEN 
element before the cutoff distance, it simply stops the calculation and starts 
again with the new SBEN (if CSR switched on in this bend), no effort is made to 
convolve the CSR fields from multiple bends. The slices are made according to a 
logarithmic distribution, with more slices closer to the bend where the CSR 
fields are changing most rapidly. A value of &gt;50 is recommended and 
experimentation suggested.<br>
