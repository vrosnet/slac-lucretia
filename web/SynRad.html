Lucretia allows the user to simulate synchrotron radiation losses in
dipole correctors, sector bends, quads, sextupoles, octupoles,
multipoles, and transverse-mode cavities.&nbsp; During tracking, there
are four possible methods of synchrotron radiation simulation, which
are determined by the SynRad tracking flag of each element:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlags.SynRad == 0:</span>&nbsp;
Synchrotron radiation is completely ignored.&nbsp; This is the default
settting of the SynRad tracking flag for all elements at instantiation
time.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlags.SynRad == 1:</span>&nbsp;
For each particle, the mean energy loss from synchrotron radiation is
calculated, taking into account the particle's momentum and the actual
field that it encounters (ie, particles which are far from the center
of a quad or other multipole magnet will have larger losses than
particles which are near the center of the magnet).&nbsp; Half of the
loss is applied at the upstream face of the element (ie, before
tracking), and half at the downstream face of the element (ie, after
tracking).&nbsp; In this way, the effect of the energy variation on the
particle's trajectory is approximately taken into account.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlags.SynRad == 2:</span>&nbsp;
For each particle, both the mean and the quantum-fluctuation components
of the synchrotron radiation are calculated.&nbsp; This is accomplished
by computing the photon critical energy (u_c) and mean number of
photons emitted (nphot) for each particle; for each particle generating
a Poisson-distribued random number with mean nphot to indicate the
actual number of photons emitted; and finally generating the actual
energy of each photon emitted by each particle according to the
incoherent synchrotron radiation spectrum.&nbsp; As with the previous
option, half the energy loss is applied pre-tracking and half is
applied post-tracking; the opening angle of the photon is
ignored.&nbsp; The spectrum generation uses a fast method developed by
A. Wolski; this method agrees very well with the analytically-expected
mean particle energy loss, and produces a spectrum of particle energy
losses which is a few percent wider than the analytically-expected one.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlags.SynRad == 3:</span>&nbsp;
Both the mean and quantum-fluctuation components of the synchrotron
radiation are calculated in exactly the method described above, except
that the generation of the photons uses H. Burkhardt's method.&nbsp; In
this case both the mean and the standard deviation of the particle
energy loss agree with the analytically-expected values to within
statistical errors, but the method is much slower than Wolski's.<br>
<br>
Methods 2 and 3 make use of Matlab's flat-distributed random number
generator, rand, in the generation of the Poisson-distributed random
numbers and also in the generation of the photon energies.&nbsp; All of
the methods make the thin-lens approximation:&nbsp; the magnetic field
experienced by a particle at the upstream face of an element, along
with its effective length, are assumed to be all that is needed to
compute the emitted radiation.&nbsp; Put another way, the fact that the
particle changes its transverse offset in a quad or other multipole
magnet, and thus changes the magnetic field that it samples as it
passes through the element, is ignored.&nbsp; If this is deemed to be
critical to correctly computing the synchrotron radiation, and its
effects on the beam dynamics, one can divide the magnets into
longitudinal slices which will more accurately emulate thin lens
elements for this purpose.<br>
<br>
The <a href="momentum_profile.html">momentum profile</a> tools will
also change their behavior based on the SynRad track flag:&nbsp; if
SynRad != 0, the
mean SR loss will be included in the momentum profile for bends,
correctors, TCAVs, and multipoles with a nonzero dipole field.&nbsp; <br>
