<div style="text-align: left;">Floodland is a module for Lucretia that extends 
	the functionality of Lucretia to include the ability to integrate into live 
	control systems to read data and affect changes to real accelerator beamline 
	devices. For example, to synchronize the Lucretia lattice variables 
	(BEAMLINE,PS,GIRDER,KLYSTRON arrays) with the values currently loaded into 
	magnets on the accelerator. Also to change magnet strengths, RF 
	voltages/phases, mover positions and so on. The idea here is to leverage the 
	existing philosophy of Lucretia (to realistically simulate the way an 
	accelerator is controlled) to extend to the control system proper. This 
	enables user code written in the simulated environment to be easily ported 
	to a working accelerator environment (and vice-versa).<br />
	<br />
	The currently supported control systems are:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/">EPICS</a>
	<a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/grp/cd/soft/aida/index.html">AIDA</a><br />
	<br />
	The Floodland module exists as a number of classes within the Lucretia/src/Floodland 
	directory, <strong>Floodland</strong> being the main one. I call Floodland a 
	&quot;module&quot; as it extends, but restricts, the normal working behavior of 
	Lucretia. In order to get the full benefit of code that works both live on 
	the accelerator and in simulation, you have to do things &quot;the Floodland 
	way&quot;. If you write algorithms etc. using Floodland objects you will ensure 
	proper functionality in both simulated and live environments. You can still 
	co-mingle with the standard set of Lucretia functions however but you have 
	to bear in mind how things will operate in the live environment.<br />
	In the Floodland directory are both &quot;core classes and functions&quot; that form 
	the backbone of the module and specify how it simulates accelerators and 
	talks to them, but also the &quot;application classes&quot;, which is to say classes 
	that use Floodland to achieve specific accelerator tasks (e.g. orbit 
	feedback). For now I am keeping everything in the one directory, it may be 
	in future that a re-structuring will be needed if the number of application 
	classes grows large.<br />
	<br />
	The strength of writing a Floodland application to perform an accelerator 
	task is that it should then be portable to different accelerator 
	environments. Each accelerator environment should just have a different 
	configuration file which sets up the linkages between the accelerator 
	components (magnet power supplies, mover systems, RF etc.) and the Floodland 
	(Lucretia) accelerator components (BEAMLINE,PS,GIRDER,KLYSTRON). In practice 
	this is quite hard to achieve- every accelerator tends to have different 
	ways of controlling accelerator components (e.g. there are a lot of 
	different ways of powering magnets, by powering multiple magnets in series, 
	having various trim coils etc. etc.). It is the aim to try and make 
	Floodland smart enough to deal with any particular case, although in 
	practice this means adding code to the core classes each time we come across 
	a new case not yet thought about. Eventually we hope this will become a 
	truly global environment for applying one set of accelerator tools to all 
	accelerators.<br />
	<br />
	Below is a list of classes and functions which currently makes up the 
	Floodland module with links to full descriptions of their use. I will also 
	in time be adding some detailed examples in the <a href="examples.html">
	examples</a> section of the main documentation to try and make the usage a 
	little clearer.<br />

	<strong>Core Classes and Functions:</strong><br />
	Floodland<br />
	FlApp<br />
	FlGui<br />
	FlMenu<br />

	<em><strong>A note on the name (Floodland): </strong></em>Like Lucretia, 
	this is just a name. It comes from the name of the album the song &quot;Lucretia 
	my Reflection&quot; which inspired the name of this software package came from by 
	the group &quot;The Sister&#39;s of Mercy&quot;.<br />
